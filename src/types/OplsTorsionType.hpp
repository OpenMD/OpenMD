   * These torsion types are defined identically with functional form given
   * in the following paper:
   *
   * "Development and Testing of the OPLS All-Atom Force Field on 
   * Conformational Energetics and Properties of Organic Liquids,"  by
   * William L. Jorgensen, David S. Maxwell, and Julian Tirado-Rives, 
   * J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1996; 118(45) pp 11225 - 11236;
   * DOI: 10.1021/ja9621760
   *
   * This torsion potential has the form:
   * 
   *  Vtors = 0.5* (v1*(1+cos(phi)) + v2*(1-cos(2*phi)) + v3*(1+cos(3*phi)))
   *
   * Notes: 
   * 
   * 1) OpenMD converts internally to a Polynomial torsion type because
   *    all of the phase angles are zero in the OPLS paper.
   * 2) Coefficients are assumed to be in kcal / mol, and be careful about
   *    that factor of 1/2 when importing the coefficients!
