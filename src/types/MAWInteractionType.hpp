   * @class MAWInteractionType
   *

   * MAWInteractionType (Metal-Angular-Water) is one of the basic
   * Metal-to-NonMetal interaction types.
   *
   * \f[ V =  D_e * \exp(-a(r-r_e)) * (\exp(-a(r-r_e)) - 2) *
                         (1 + ca1*(1-\sqrt(3)*\cos(\theta))^2 +
                              cb1*3*(\sin(\theta)*\cos(\phi))^2) \f]

   * The spherical coordinates are defined in the body-fixed frame
   * of a rigid-body water molecule (HO bonds are on the Y-Z plane)
   * and the dipole vector of the water molecule points along the
   * Z-axis.  A metal atom's position is uniquely defined by a set
   * of spherical polar coordinates \f$(r, \theta, \phi)\f$ in the
   * body-fixed frame of each water molecule.
