   * @class CharmmTorsionType CharmmTorsionType.hpp
   * "types/CharmmTorsionType.hpp" These torsion types are defined identically
   * with functional form given in the following paper:
   *
   * "A. D. MacKerell, Jr. et al., CHARMM: The energy function and its
   * parameterization with an overview of the program," in The
   * Encyclopedia of Computational Chemistry, edited by
   * P. v. R. Schleyer, et al., volume 1, pages 271â€“277, John Wiley &
   * Sons, New York, 1998.
   *
   * This torsion potential has the form:
   *
   * \f[ V_{\mathrm{torsion}}(\phi) = \sum_n K_n \left( 1 + \cos(n \phi -
   * \delta_n) \right) \f]
   *
   * Notes:
   *
   * 1. OpenMD converts internally to Chebyshev polynomials for
   *    computational efficiency.
   * 2. Coefficients \f$ K_n \f$ are assumed to be in kcal / mol.
   * 3. Phase angles \f$ \delta_n \f$ are assumed to be in degrees.
   * 4. Periodicity values \f$ n \f$ are positive integers.
   *
   * Internally convert CHARMM torsion functions to two polynomials
   * based on Chebyshev polynomials in cos(phi):
   *
   * \f[ V_{\mathrm{torsion}}(\phi) = \sum_n K_n + \sum_n K_n \cos(\delta_n)
   * T_n(\cos(\phi)) - \sum_n K_n \sin(\delta_n) U_{n-1}((\cos \phi)) \sin(\phi)
   * \f]
   *
   * This conversion has used the cosine addition formula, and two
   * identities of Chebyshev polynomials:
   *
   * \f[ T_n (\cos \phi) = \cos(n \phi) \f]
   *
   * for Chebyshev polynomials of the first type, and:
   *
   * \f[ U_{n-1} (\cos \phi) \sin(\phi) = \sin( n \phi ) \f]
   *
   * for Chebyshev polynomials of the second type. We're left with a
   * simpler equation for the torsion potential in terms of only
   * polynomials of the cosine and an additional sine of the angle:
   *
   * \f[ V_{\mathrm{torsion}}(\phi) = C + T(\cos(\phi)) + U(\cos(\phi)) \sin(\phi)
   * \f] where: \f[ C = \sum_n K_n \f] \f[ T(\cos(\phi)) = \sum_n K_n
   * \cos(\delta_n) T_n(\cos(\phi)) \f] \f[ U(\cos(\phi)) = \sum_n -K_n
   * \sin(\delta_n) U_{n-1}(\cos(\phi)) \f]
