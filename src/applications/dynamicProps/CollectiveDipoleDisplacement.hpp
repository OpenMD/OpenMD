  //! Calculates the collective dipole displacement function
  /*! This time correlation function is the Helfand moment conjugate
      to the current density. Helfand moments are used to calculate
      the Einstein-Helfand relations for transport that are formally
      equivalent to Green-Kubo expressions using a related flux.  In
      this case, the flux,

      \f[ \mathbf{J}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} q_i \mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{cm},i}(t) \f]

      is normally used to calculate an ionic conductivity,

      \f[ \sigma = \frac{1}{3V k_b T} \int_0^\infty \left< \mathbf{J}(0) \cdot
     \mathbf{J}(t) \right> dt \f]

      The cm subscript denotes center of mass locations for all molecules.

      This class computes the collective translational dipole moment,

      \f[ \mathbf{M}_\mathrm{trans}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} q_i
     \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{cm},i}(t) \f]

      as well as total contributions to the system's net dipole moment

      \f[ \mathbf{M}_\mathrm{tot}(t) =  \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{a} q_{ia}
     \mathbf{r}_{ia}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} q_i \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{cq},i}(t) \f]

      where cq denotes the molecular center of charge.  It also
      calculates the rotational contribution,

      \f[ \mathbf{M}_\mathrm{rot}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} q_i \left[
     \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{cq},i}(t) - \mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{cm},i}(t) \right] \f]

      The correlation functions are the displacements of these terms
      from their values at an earlier time,

      \f[ \left< \left| \mathbf{M}_\mathrm{trans}(t) -
     \mathbf{M}_\mathrm{trans}(0) \right|^2 \right> \f]

      and identical quantities for the total and rotational contributions.
