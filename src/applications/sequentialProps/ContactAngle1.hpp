  /// Calculates the contact angle of a droplet with a surface
  /// using a spherical cap approximation for the droplet.

  /**  The position of the spherical cap relative to the surface plane
       is determined by the center-of-mass position of the selection,
       and this method assumes a uniform density in the droplet.  The
       angle of intersection between the surface of the spherical cap
       and the plane defines the contact angle, which is related to
       the center of mass height by:

       \f$ z_\mathrm{cm} = (2)^{-4/3} R_0 \left(
       \frac{1-\cos\theta}{2+\cos\theta}\right)^{1/3}
       \frac{3+\cos\theta}{2+\cos\theta} \f$

       where \f$z_\mathrm{cm}\f$ is measured relative to the planar
       surface, and \f$R_0\f$ is the radius of the free spherical
       droplet.

       This method was first proposed in:

       J. Hautman and M.L. Klein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 67(13), 1763 (1991).
       DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.1763

       This Analyzer requires statement of the reference height of the
       solid surface, solidZ, and \f$R_0\f$, the dropletRadius.
