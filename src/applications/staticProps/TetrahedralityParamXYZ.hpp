   * @class TetrahedralityParamXYZ
   * @brief Tetrahedrality Parameter XYZ
   *
   * Computes local tetrahedral order parameter Q as introduced in:
   *
   *  "A new order parameter for tetrahedral configurations," by P.-L. Chau and 
   *    A.J. Hardwick, Mol. Phys. 93, pp. 511-518 (1998).
   *
   *
   * Note that we use a rescaled version of the tetrahedral order
   * parameter 'Q' such that a perfectly tetrahedral configuration has a Q value
   * of 1 and an ideal gas configuration has a Q value of 0. This rescaled
   * version of the tetrahedrality parameter was first introduced in:
   *
   *  "Relationship between structural order and the anomalies of liquid water,"
   *    by J.R. Errington and P.G. Debenedetti, Nature 409, pp. 318-321 (2001).
   * 
   *
   * Characterization of the spatial correlations of the the local
   * order parameter Q are done according to the procedure outlined
   * in:
   *
   *   "Space-time correlations in the orientational order parameter and the
   *    orientational entropy of water," by P. Kumar, S.V. Buldyrev, and 
   *    H.E. Stanley, arXiv:0807.4699v1 [cond-mat.soft] 29 Jul 2008.
