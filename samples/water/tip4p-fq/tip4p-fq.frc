# Since they gave chi as an electronegativity difference, we will assign 
# Oxygen's (the M site actually for TIP4P) electronegativity from Rappe 
# and Goddard III, and setting H to equal the difference.
# Rappe and Goddard, O or M chi: 8.741 eV = 201.5705 kcal/mol
# Rick, Stuart, and Berne, delta Chi between O and H = 68.49
# SlaterZeta has units of Bohr radius
# Fictitious ChargeMass has units of (fs / e)^2 kcal / mol  (note the 
#    ps->fs difference between this code and the Rick, Stuart, and Berne paper
