# Structures for simulating Ice-Ih

This directory contains unit cell and larger structures for
simulations of ice crystals. Unless otherwise stated, these crystals
are oriented such that the basal face is normal to the z-axis.

## Proton-disordered ice crystals

The following proton-disordered ice-Ih crystals,

+ 3x3x2-C2.omd
+ 3x3x2-e.omd
+ 3x3x2.omd
+ 5x3x3.omd
+ 6x4x4.omd
+ 3x3x2-CH.omd
+ 3x3x2-h.omd
+ 4x3x2.omd
+ 6x3x3.omd
+ 9x5x1.omd

were taken from the supporting information of "Unit cells for
hexagonal ice" by J. A. Hayward and J. R. Reimers, *J. Chem. Phys.*
**106**, 1518 (1997).

## Proton-ordered ice unit cells

The following structures are unit cells for proton-ordered ice-Ih
crystals.

+ HO-struct1.omd
+ HO-struct2.omd
+ HO-struct3.omd
+ HO-struct4.omd
+ HO-struct5.omd
+ HO-struct6.omd
+ HO-struct7.omd
+ HO-struct8.omd
+ HO-struct9.omd
+ HO-struct10.omd
+ HO-struct11.omd
+ HO-struct12.omd
+ HO-struct3.omd
+ HO-struct14.omd
+ HO-struct15.omd
+ HO-struct16.omd

These structures come from Table 1. in "Quantum-Chemical and
Force-Field Investigations of Ice Ih" by Thomas K. Hirsch and Lars
Ojamae, *J. Phys. Chem. B* **108**, 15856-15864 (2004).
DOI: [10.1021/jp048434u](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp048434u)

NOTE: HO-struct1.omd	is actually ice XI.

When replicated, HO-struct6.omd and HO-struct7.omd create proton
stripes on the basal surfaces.

## Creating large ice crystals from these structures 

In order to generate larger crystals from these structures, use
omd2omd with the -x -y -z flags to replicate these unit cells in the
x, y, and z dimensions.

```
omd2omd -i HO-struct1.omd -o bigCrystal.omd -x 5 -y 3 -z 5
```

Also, while you are unable to cleave the crystals with the current
OpenMD software, you are able to rotate these crystals exposing the
prismatic and secondary prismatic facets using the -p -q -r
functionality of omd2omd.

```
omd2omd -i bigCrystal.omd -o prismFace.omd -p 90 -q 90 -r 0
```

## Expected Output

If you want to visualize what was just made, you can use the `Dump2XYZ` utility:

```
Dump2XYZ -i prismFace.omd -b -m
jmol prismFace.xyz
```

You should see this structure.  Here, a side view of this structure shows the prism face at the top and bottom:

## Sample equilibration scheme

NOTE: These structures are ideal ice crystals, and should be *gently*
equilibrated with whichever water model you choose. Depending on the
model, these starting structures may be more or less stable. A
sample equilibration scheme might be:

1. Short `ensemble = NPTxyz;` run at a low temperature, approximately 
   10 to 50 K, with `resetTime` set to a small time, approximately 
   10 to 50 fs.
2. Once the pressure tensor elements are nearly zero and the volume is
   oscillating around some average, use `affineScale` to scale the
   simulation cell to the average volume. Comment out `resetTime` to 
   turn resets off.
3. Perform an `ensemble = NVT;` simulation with the `targetTemp` set 
   to your desired temperature.
4. When the temperature has reached the target, and the total energy
   is oscillating around some average, use `thermalizer -e` to scale 
   the simulation energy to this average energy.
5. You can now perform `ensemble = NVE;` data collection simulations.
