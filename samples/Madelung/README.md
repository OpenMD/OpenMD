# Madelung Energy

## Background Information

## Instructions

## Expected Output

The sample in this directory provides a way of checking the value of
the Madelung Energy for a perfect crystal of NaCl.  The relevant
quantities are:

```
M (Madelung constant) = 1.74756
a (lattice constant)  = 5.65 Angstroms
q^2 / (4 pi e0 a)     = 58.77233   kcal / mol
M q^2 / (4 pi e0 a)   = 102.708173 kcal / mol
```

The file NaCl.omd contains 8000 ions, so the total electrostatic energy
of the perfect crystal in this file should be:

```
V_electrostatic = -821665.38  kcal / mol
```

Using different electrostatic calculation methods, we can get quite
close to this value.

For example, with :
```
cutoffMethod = "shifted_force";
electrostaticScreeningMethod = "damped";
cutoffRadius = 28;
dampingAlpha = 0.14159292;
```

The resultant electrostatic potential is:
```
V_electrostatic = -821667.68 kcal / mol
```

To obtain values for the electrostatic potential in OpenMD, we add the
`ELECTROSTATIC_POTENTIAL` keyword to the end of the statFileFormat:

```
statFileFormat = "TIME|TOTAL_ENERGY|POTENTIAL_ENERGY|KINETIC_ENERGY|TEMPERATURE|PRESSURE|VOLUME|CONSERVED_QUANTITY|ELECTROSTATIC_POTENTIAL";
```
