# Bond Order

## Background Information

These are sample files used to test the bond order parameter
code in StaticProps.  Perfect SC, BCC, FCC, HCP, and Icosahedral
clusters have known analytic values for the bond order parameter
and the files in this directory can be used to make sure the
correct values are being computed.  The central atom in each
cluster is a copper atom, so the proper way to run the tests would
be a command like:

  $(OPENMD_HOME)/bin/StaticProps --bo -i bcc.omd --rcut=9 --sele1="select Cu"

legend:

  hcp.omd                 = Hexagonal Close Packed structure
  bcc.omd                 = Body Centered Cubic structure
  fcc.omd                 = Face Centered Cubic structure
  sc.omd                  = Simple Cubic structure
  icosahedron.omd         = Icosahedral cluster
  surface_icosahedron.omd = Half of a Icosahedral Cluster approximating a nanoparticle surface atom
  tet.omd                 = Tetrahedral cluster

(Cu atoms are located at (0,0,0), and Au atoms surround Cu in the clusters.)
