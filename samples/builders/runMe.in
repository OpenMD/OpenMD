# This is a collection of sample commands that can be used to build
# OpenMD start files.  In OpenMD, the start files have a <MetaData>
# block to give information about the kind of simulation being performed.
# The start files also contain at least one <Snapshot> block which contains
# information about the instantaneous configuration.  
#
# One of the difficult tasks in using any simulation program is figuring
# out how to format the start file correctly.  OpenMD includes a set of
# "builder" programs to make that process a bit less painful.
#
# Example 1:
# Builds an FCC lattice from the <MetaData> block in one_component.md
# Uses 5 unit cells in each direction, a density of 1.0 g / cm^3, and
# places the output (which can be used to start an OpenMD job) in 
# FCC.md
#
# Note that builders will rewrite the number of molecules in each component
# to match the number of lattice sites.
#
# The thermalizer command takes the FCC.md file and resamples the velocities
# from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution set to 100K:
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/simpleBuilder -o FCC.md --nx=5 --ny=5 --nz=5 --density=1.0 one_component.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o FCC-100K.md -t 100 FCC.md
#
# Example 2:
# Builds an FCC lattice from the <MetaData> block in three_component.md
# uses 4 unit cells in each direction, a density of 1.0 g / cm^3, and
# molFractions of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2 for the three components.  Places
# the output (which can be used to start an OpenMD job) in random_FCC.md
#
# Note that builders will rewrite the number of molecules in each component
# to match the number of lattice sites.
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/randomBuilder -o random_FCC.md --nx=4 --ny=4 --nz=4 --density=1.0 --molFraction=0.4 --molFraction=0.4 three_component.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o random_FCC-100K.md -t 100 random_FCC.md
#
# Example 3:
# Builds a spherical nanoparticle (FCC) from the <MetaData> block in gold.md
# using a particle radius of 30 Angstroms, and a lattice constant of 4.09
# angstroms. Places the output (which can be used to start an OpenMD job) in 
# gold_sphere.md 
#
# Note that builders will rewrite the number of molecules in each component
# to match the number of lattice sites.
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/nanoparticleBuilder -o gold_sphere.md --radius=30.0 --latticeConstant=4.09 gold.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o gold_sphere-500K.md -t 500.0 gold_sphere.md
#
# Example 4:
# Builds a random alloy spherical nanoparticle (FCC) from the <MetaData> 
# block in bimetallic.md using a particle radius of 30 Angstroms, a 
# lattice constant of 4.09 angstroms, and a mole fraction for the gold of 0.4.
# Places the output (which can be used to start an OpenMD job) in 
# Au_Ag_alloy.md 
#
# Note that builders will rewrite the number of molecules in each component
# to match the number of lattice sites.
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/nanoparticleBuilder -o Au_Ag_alloy.md --radius=30.0 --latticeConstant=4.09 --molFraction=0.4 bimetallic.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o Au_Ag_alloy-600K.md -t 600 Au_Ag_alloy.md
#
# Example 5:
# Builds a Au(core)-Ag(shell) spherical nanoparticle (FCC) from the <MetaData> 
# block in bimetallic.md using a particle radius of 25 Angstroms, a 
# lattice constant of 4.09 angstroms, and a core radius for the gold atoms 
# of 12.5 angstroms. Places the output (which can be used to start an 
# OpenMD job) in Au(core)-Ag(shell).md 
#
# Note that builders will rewrite the number of molecules in each component
# to match the number of lattice sites.
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/nanoparticleBuilder -o Au-core-Ag-shell.md --radius=30.0 --latticeConstant=4.09 --shellRadius=12.5 bimetallic.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o Au-core-Ag-shell-800K.md -t 800.0 Au-core-Ag-shell.md
#
# Example 6:
# Reverses example 5 by building a Ag(core)-Au(shell) spherical nanoparticle.
# Uses the same <MetaData> block from bimetallic.md, 
# a particle radius of 25 Angstroms, a lattice constant of 4.09 angstroms, 
# and a core radius for the silver atoms of 12.5 angstroms.  
# Places the output (which can be used to start an OpenMD job) in 
# Ag(core)-Au(shell).md 
#
# Note that the last radius in Example 5 was taken as the particle radius,
# but since the components are reversed in this example, both are specified:
# 
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/nanoparticleBuilder -o Ag-core-Au-shell.md --radius=30.0 --latticeConstant=4.09 --shellRadius=30.0,12.5 bimetallic.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o Ag-core-Au-shell-800K.md -t 800.0 Ag-core-Au-shell.md
#
# Example 7:
# Builds a Au(core)-Ag(shell) spherical nanoparticle (FCC) from the <MetaData> 
# block in bimetallic.md using a particle radius of 25 Angstroms, a 
# lattice constant of 4.09 angstroms, and a core radius for the gold atoms 
# of 12.5 angstroms. Places the output (which can be used to start an 
# OpenMD job) in Au(core)-Ag(shell).md 
#
# This example also introduces 70% vacancies in a 6 angstrom radial band
# around the bimetallic interface:
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/nanoparticleBuilder -o vacancy_interface.md --radius=20.0 --latticeConstant=4.09 --shellRadius=12.5 --vacancyPercent=70 --vacancyInnerRadius=9.5 --vacancyOuterRadius=15.5 bimetallic.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o vacancy_interface-800K.md -t 800 vacancy_interface.md
#
# Example 8:
# Builds a random alloy spherical nanoparticle with 30% vacancies using the
# <MetaData> block in bimetallic.md, a particle radius of 30 Angstroms, a 
# lattice constant of 4.09 angstroms, and a mole fraction for the gold of 0.4.
# Places the output (which can be used to start an OpenMD job) in 
# vacancy_alloy.md
#
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/nanoparticleBuilder -o vacancy_alloy.md --radius=30.0 --latticeConstant=4.09 --molFraction=0.4 --vacancyPercent=80 bimetallic.md
${OPENMD_HOME}/bin/thermalizer -o vacancy_alloy-900K.md -t 900 vacancy_alloy.md
#
#Example 9:
# Builds a spherically-capped nanorod (FCC) from the <MetaData> block in gold.md
# using a nanorod radius of 20 Angstroms, a length of 50 Angstroms and a lattice constant of 4.08
# angstroms. Places the output (which can be used to start an OpenMD job) in 
# gold_fccrod.md 
#
# Note that builders will rewrite the number of molecules in each component
