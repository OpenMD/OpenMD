# Metals

## Background Information

Contained here are examples of (111) cut surfaces of the coinage
metals, as well as a few of the catalytically active metals.

### slabBuilder

OpenMD also has a utility script which makes creation of these types
of systems trivial. `slabBuilder` is a python script which generates
*sc*, *bcc*, and *fcc* lattices and cleaves the crystals along a
desired *(hkl)* plane. The systems are then reoriented such that the
cleaved facet is presented to the z-dimension of the simulation
box. `slabBuilder` comes with a help message when passed `-h` or
`--help`.
